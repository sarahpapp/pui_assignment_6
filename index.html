                  <p>Through the course of this project, we partnered closely with Sandeep Konam, director of the Konam Foundation, and Kanna Siripurapu with the Nirman Foundation to conduct further product and market research and develop a data model and interface that would contribute to improved outcomes for marginalized farmers in Rayagada and Nayagarh in Odisha, India.</p>

                  <h4>What did we set out to accomplish?</h4>
                  <p>While there are many ways to contribute to improvements in the lives of our target audience, our task was to leverage data to predict a valuable result so that farmers and aid workers would be able to make informed planning decisions. Ultimately, the focus of the work during this project was to both conduct audience research that would direct the design of the product and design a data model that would produce the desired results.</p>
                  <p>The tool that we developed during the course of this project is meant to deliver an actionable prediction, based on individuals' crop and financial information, that allows them to achieve sustainable financial independence. In this context financial independence means in the short-term, paying off existing loans and in the long-term, financial stability, self-sustainability, removing dependency on loans. The version of the product that we developed focuses on the profit prediction, but eventually, as more data is available and included as features in the data model, we envision the output of the model to be a plan or detailed recommendation for farmers to optimize their crop selection based on individual factors such as location, farm size, and personal finances.

This would allow us the benefit of creating a compelling and relevant tool for our audience and ensure market fit with a region that most of the team was largely unfamiliar with. Key questions we sought to answer include:</p>
                    <p>How do our users currently plan their crops and manage their finances?</p>
                    <p>What problems do they experience with their current process?</p>

                  <h3><em>Understanding our users</em></h3>
                  <h4>What is the current experience of our users?</h4>
                  <p>We assembled a survey that would give us a better understanding of our users’ lives and experiences. We asked questions around crop planning, farm work distribution, finances, land ownership, and device ownership and usage. Over the course of roughly three weeks, we saw responses from 52 small farmers living and operating farms in Odisha.</p>

                  <h5>Findings</h5>

                  <p>The survey results revealed that the majority of our farmer users would be using feature phones. Additionally, Internet access is very limited, so even those with smartphones do not have reliable access to the web. Our participant group tended to plan their crops based off of past success or tradition, but if they did change their crops, it was because of influence from their neighbors. Problems they tend to have include unanticipated market influences, environmental events (like major storms), and revolving debt.</p>

                  <h5>Implications</h5>

                  <p>While the initial concept of a web app for farmers to use directly is very attractive, in order to reach our target user base, our product will need to serve multiple use cases including offline mode and use by NGO staff as they visit or remotely meet with farmers to offer them guidance on planning their crops. A web app would work for literate NGO staff with access to smartphones, but not for farmer users.</p>

                  <h3><em>Validating our initial concept</em></h3>
                  <h4>Is there product market fit?</h4>
                  <p>In parallel to the user survey (due to a condensed timeline), we developed an initial prototype of a web app that appears to users to take planning data like desired crop and existing debt and investments and then displays related results in the form of risk prediction and recommendations. We first created an English prototype to align on the first design and then translated the prototype into Odiya for the field test. We tested the first prototype with six farmers and five NGO staff members. Overall the concept was very attractive, but financial literacy and cost benefit analysis associated with it are areas that the farmer audience doesn’t yet generally grasp, which indicates that providing this tool as just a part of an NGO staff member’s advice and guidance would be a successful route to product adoption.</p> 

                  <h4>What can be done to improve the experience?</h4>
                  <p>Subsequent versions of the prototype were made to include additional regions within Odisha and relevant crop options as our field test traveled to different sites with one of our key stakeholders. As more feedback came in around farmers needing additional assistance with understanding the written questions, we also updated the question screen layout to include room for an audio icon, and eventually, to include audio versions of each question to encourage independent usage of the web app amongst farmers, even if they’re using an NGO staff member’s smartphone. In total, we completed two main versions of a click through prototype and one version of a coded prototype. Click on the graphic on the left to view photos from our first study.</p>

                  <p>After our initial round of research, we developed some hard contraints with which to work. From there we developed design guidelines for future work and a final web app prototype to help a future team of developers pick up from where we left off.</p>

                <h3><em>Defining obstacles</em></h3>
                <h4>What design constraints are we working with?</h4>
                <p>User testing confirmed and revealed some obstacles for adoption of this product as follows:</p>
                <h5>Farmer device and internet connectivity</h5>
                <p>Farmers in rural areas do not typically have access to smartphones or stable internet access, making a web app unrealistic for them.</p>
                <h5>Communication</h5>
                <p>A high percentage of rural farmers have low-literacy or trouble reading and might not speak Odiya, but instead a less common dialect. This indicates that there continues to be a need for outside assistance to guide farmers through the process of accessing accurate predictions.</p>
                <h5>Farmer financial literacy</h5>
                <p>The target audience generally lacks an understanding of financial concepts such as profit and loss, cost benefit analysis, and debt and credit. While this app can assist with planning, more needs to be done to help with the educating this audience.</p>
                <h5>Crop planning process</h5>
                <p>Currently, crop decisions (e.g. what to grow and how to do so) are generally made by farmers by looking their neighbors and others in their immediate community. In order for change to take place, a more convincing argument needs to be made for a more data-driven approach.</p>

                <p>Looking towards future versions and the features that they will need to include to promote usage, we recommend the following:</p>
                <li>Plan for NGO staff to install the web app on their smartphones as they head out into the field so that they can access the app in offline mode.</li>
                <li>Plan for each staff member to integrate the app into their ongoing work in educating farmers on best practices and improvements to their operations.</li>
                <li>Plan field visits towards the end of each growing season, to catch farmers before they start work for the next season.</li>
